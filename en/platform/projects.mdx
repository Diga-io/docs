# Projects

Projects in Diga represent the organizations that use the platform to manage AI voice agents. Each project operates independently with its own set of resources, billing configuration, and team members.

## Overview

Projects are the main organizational unit in Diga. They provide a multi-tenant environment that allows the platform to serve multiple organizations while maintaining strict data isolation. All platform resources (agents, calls, contacts, phone numbers, etc.) are associated with a specific project.

### Key Capabilities

- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of data and resources between projects
- **Team Management**: Support for multiple users with role-based access control
- **Specific Resources**: All platform resources are associated with a project
- **Billing Integration**: Each project has its own subscription and payment configuration

## Create a Project

When you create a new project, it is automatically configured with:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic information">
    Provide a descriptive name and optional description for your project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your role">
    You are automatically assigned as the project administrator
  </Step>

  <Step title="Billing configuration">
    A Stripe customer is created and a free subscription is initialized
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial resources">
    Your project is ready to start creating agents and managing calls
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Each user can create multiple projects. There is no limit on the number of projects you can manage.
</Note>

Administrators can invite new members to the project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access member management">
    Go to Settings &gt; Members

### Team Roles

Each project member has one of two roles:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **Administrator** | Full administrative access | Can manage all resources, members, billing, and project configuration |
| **Member** | Limited access for daily operations | Can view resources and make calls, but cannot modify configuration or manage team |

<Info>
For more details on specific permissions, see the [Roles and Permissions](/en/platform/roles-permissions) page.
</Info>

### Manage Members

Administrators can:

- View all project members and their roles
- Change a member's role (from Member to Administrator or vice versa)
- Remove members from the project

<Warning>
You cannot remove the last administrator from a project. You must promote another member to administrator first.
</Warning>

## Project Resources

All these resources are associated with your project:

### Agents
- AI voice agents configured with prompts and conversational flows
- Each agent belongs to a single project

## Project Billing

Each project has its own independent billing configuration:

- **Stripe Customer**: A unique Stripe customer per project

- **Included Minutes**: Assigned monthly according to plan
- **Phone Numbers**: Monthly charge per number
- **Additional Usage**: Extra minutes beyond the plan

## Project Deletion

Administrators can delete a project when it is no longer needed:

<Warning>
Project deletion is a permanent action. Although the project record is preserved in the database (soft deletion), access and memberships for all members are removed.

  <Step title="Verify requirements">
    - You must be a project administrator
    - The project must not be your only project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to settings">
    Access Settings &gt; Project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete project">
    Click "Delete project" and confirm the action
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirmation">
    The project will be marked as deleted and removed from your project list
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize by environment or client">
    Create separate projects for different clients or environments (development, production) to keep resources organized and isolated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintain at least two administrators">
    Assign at least two administrators per project to avoid loss of access if one administrator is unavailable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review members regularly">
    Periodically audit who has access to your project and remove members who no longer need access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Choose clear, descriptive names for your projects, especially if you manage multiple projects.
  </Accordion>

## Frequently Asked Questions

    There is no limit on the number of projects you can create. Each project has its own independent billing.
