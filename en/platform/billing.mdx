# Billing

Diga's billing system is subscription-based and fully integrated with Stripe for payment processing. Each project has its own independent billing configuration that includes subscription plans, included minutes, and additional charges.

## Overview

Billing in Diga works per project, which means each project has:

- Its own Stripe customer
- An independent subscription plan
- Monthly minute allocation
- Separate billing for phone numbers and additional usage

<Note>
Minutes are assigned **monthly** regardless of the billing period (monthly or annual). For example, an annual plan with 120,000 minutes per year will receive 10,000 minutes each month.
</Note>

## Subscription Plans

Diga offers several subscription plans to suit different needs:

### Free Plan

Ideal for trying out the platform:

- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Included minutes**: 30 minutes/month

### Additional Charges

In addition to the base plan, the following charges apply:

**Phone Numbers**
- €1.95 + VAT per phone number per month
- Numbers are billed monthly

**Additional Usage (Extra Minutes)**
- If you exceed your included minutes, additional minutes are charged
- Extra minutes are billed monthly
- You can disable additional usage to avoid unexpected charges

## How Billing Works

### Usage Tracking

Diga tracks your project usage in seconds for greater precision:

- **Internally in seconds**: The system tracks in seconds for precise calculations
- **Displayed in minutes**: The interface shows usage in minutes for clarity
- **Real-time updates**: The usage counter updates after each call

### Billing Period

Your billing period depends on your plan:

- **Monthly**: You are billed each month on your subscription date
- **Annual**: You are billed once a year, but minutes are assigned monthly

<CodeGroup>
```text Monthly Example
Plan: Pro Monthly
Included minutes: 10,000/month
Billing date: 15th of each month
```

```text Annual Example
Plan: Pro Annual
Included minutes: 120,000/year (10,000/month)
Billing date: 15th each year
Monthly minute renewal: 15th of each month
```
</CodeGroup>

### Minute Rollover

Diga includes a rollover system so you don't lose unused minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accumulate unused minutes">
    Minutes you don't use in a month roll over to the next month
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rollover limit">
    Rollover is limited to 2x your plan's included minutes to avoid unlimited accumulation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rollover usage">
    Rollover minutes are automatically used before consuming additional usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Rollover Example**:
- Plan: 10,000 minutes/month
- Month 1: You use 5,000 minutes → Rollover: 5,000 minutes
- Month 2: You have 15,000 minutes available (10,000 new + 5,000 rollover)
- Maximum rollover limit: 20,000 minutes (2x the plan)
