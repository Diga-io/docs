## What are Integrations?

Integrations allow your phone agents to connect with external systems during conversations. Instead of manually programming each API call, you define reusable **tools** that your agents can use when needed.

For example, a support agent can:
- Look up customer information in your CRM
- Create tickets in your management system
- Process returns in your payment platform
- Check inventory in your database

All of this happens in real-time during the phone conversation, without the user having to wait.

<Note>
  Integrations are optional. You can create agents that only converse without performing external actions. Use them when you need your agent to **do something** besides talking.
</Note>

## Common Use Cases

Integrations elevate your agents' capabilities across multiple cases:

**Customer Service**
- Look up customer information in CRM
- Check order status
- Create support tickets

**Sales and Commerce**
- Check product availability
- Verify prices and discounts
- Process orders

**Financial Services**
- Check account balances
- Verify transactions
- Process refunds

## Key Concepts

### Tools

A **tool** is a specific action your agent can perform. Examples:
- `search_customer` - Searches for a customer by phone or email
- `create_ticket` - Creates a support ticket
- `check_inventory` - Verifies product availability
- `process_refund` - Initiates a return

Each tool has:
- **Name**: Unique identifier (e.g., `search_customer`)
- **Description**: Explains when to use it
- **Parameters**: Information it needs (e.g., phone number, email)

### Integrations

An **integration** is a container that groups related tools and manages the connection with an external system.

For example, a "Zendesk" integration could include:
- `search_customer`
- `create_ticket`
- `update_ticket`
- `check_ticket_status`

Integrations also store the credentials (API keys, tokens) needed to authenticate with the external system.

## How Integrations Work During a Call

When a user is on a call with your agent, it can use assigned tools to perform actions in real-time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="The user requests something">
    The user makes a request during the conversation (e.g., "What's the status of my order 12345?")
  </Step>

  <Step title="The agent identifies the need">
    The agent recognizes it needs to use a tool to respond (e.g., `check_order`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="The agent calls the tool">
    The agent executes the tool with the necessary parameters (e.g., `order_id=12345`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="The external system responds">
    The integration queries the external system and returns the data to the agent
  </Step>

  <Step title="The agent responds to the user">
    The agent uses the received information to give a clear response (e.g., "Your order is on its way and should arrive tomorrow")
  </Step>
</Steps>

All of this happens in seconds, without the user having to wait or be transferred.

## Types of Integrations

Diga supports two types of integrations:

    Tools are automatically synced from the server. The provider manages updates.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Confirmation

For sensitive actions (like processing payments or deleting data), you can require **explicit user confirmation** before executing a tool.

When you configure user confirmation, the agent:
1. Explains what action it's going to perform
2. Asks for user confirmation ("Do you confirm you want to process the $50 refund?")
3. Waits for an affirmative response
4. Only then executes the tool

This adds a layer of security for critical operations.

<Tip>
  **Recommendation**: Enable user confirmation for any tool that could have important or irreversible consequences.
