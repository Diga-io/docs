## What are HTTP Integrations?

HTTP integrations allow you to connect your agents with **any REST API** you use or control. It's the most flexible way to integrate external systems, from CRMs to payment platforms, databases, or internal services.

Unlike MCP integrations that sync tools automatically, with HTTP **you manually define** each tool: what endpoint to call, what parameters to send, and how to authenticate.

## Create an HTTP Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Integrations">
    From the dashboard, go to the **Integrations** section and click **New Integration**.

    Select the **HTTP** type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Connection">
    Define the basic details of your integration:

    **Name**: Identifies your integration (e.g., "Zendesk", "YourCompanyAPI")

    **Base URL**: The domain and base path of the API (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com/v1`)

    **Description**: (Optional) Explain what this integration is for
    **Credentials**: Depending on the server, it may require:
    - Bearer Token
    - Custom Headers
    - No authentication

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Integration">
    Once the connection is confirmed, save the integration.

    Now you can create tools that use this integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create Tools

Once the integration is created, you need to define the **tools** (specific actions) your agents can use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Integration">
    In the integrations list, select the one you just created.

    Click **New Tool**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define the Tool">
    Configure the action details:

    **Name**: Unique identifier in snake_case format (e.g., `search_customer`, `create_ticket`)

    **Description**: Explain when the agent should use this tool. Be specific.

    <Tip>
      **Good description**: "Use this tool when the user provides their order number and wants to know their shipping status"

      **Bad description**: "Check orders"
    </Tip>

    **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

    **Endpoint**: Path relative to the base URL (e.g., `/customers`, `/tickets/create`)

    **Custom Headers**: (Optional) Add specific headers for this tool, if needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Parameters">
    Specify what information the tool needs. Parameters are optional (depending on the API) and we can find two types:

    **Query Parameters**: Sent in the URL (e.g., `?status=open&limit=5`)

    **Body Parameters**: Sent in the request body (JSON)

    For each parameter, define the following fields:
    - **Name**: Unique identifier (e.g., `customer_id`, `status`). Must be the name of the value the API expects.
    - **Description**: What information it represents and how to obtain it
    - **Data Type**: string, number, boolean, array, object
    - **Required**: Whether it's required or not
    - **Retrieval Mode**: How the agent gets this value:
      - Prompt: The agent asks the user or infers it from context
      - Fixed value: A constant value you define when creating the tool

    <Warning>
      The parameter description is key for the agent to understand what value it should provide. Be clear and specific.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Complete Example: CRM Integration

Let's create an integration with a fictional CRM to search for customers.

### 1. Create the Integration

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/crear-integracion-http.png" alt="HTTP integration creation screen showing name, base URL, and credentials fields" />
</Frame>

### 2. Create Tool: Search Customer


- Basic configuration:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/herramienta-http-crear.png" alt="HTTP tool creation screen showing name, description, method, and endpoint fields" />
</Frame>

- Endpoint and method:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/herramienta-http-endpoint.png" alt="HTTP endpoint and method configuration for the search customer tool" />
</Frame>

- Parameters:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/herramienta-http-query.png" alt="JSON body configuration for the search customer tool with customer_id parameter" />
</Frame>

### 3. Usage Example in Call

```
User: My email is john@example.com, what orders do I have?

Agent: [Calls search_customer with email="john@example.com"]

API responds:
{
  "customers": [{
    "id": "cust_123",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1612345678"
  }]
}

Agent: Hi John, I see you have an account with us.
        Let me check your orders...
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clear Nomenclature">
    **Tool names**:
    - Use verbs that describe the action: `search_`, `create_`, `update_`, `delete_`
    - snake_case format: `check_inventory`, not `checkInventory`
    - Be specific: `create_support_ticket`, not just `create`

    **Parameter names**:
    - Consistent with the API: use the same names as the documentation
    - Descriptive: `customer_id` better than `id`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Precise Descriptions">
    Descriptions help the agent decide when to use each tool.

    **Good descriptions include**:
    - When to use the tool (trigger)
    - What information it needs from the user
    - What it exactly does

    **Example**:
    ```
    ✅ GOOD:
    "Use this tool when the user mentions their order
    number and wants to know their shipping status. Requires the
    complete order number (e.g., ORD-12345)."

    ❌ BAD:
    "Check orders"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    Define what the agent should do if the tool fails:

    **In the agent prompt**, add instructions like:
    ```markdown
    ## Tool Error Handling

    If a tool fails:
    1. Don't repeat the technical error to the user
    2. Explain the problem in simple language
    3. Offer an alternative

    Example:
    "I'm sorry, I can't access that information right now.
    Can I help you with something else or would you prefer
    me to transfer you to a human agent?"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credential Security">
    - **Rotate credentials regularly**: Update API keys every 3-6 months
    - **Use read-only credentials** when possible
    - **Separate environments**: Different credentials for staging and production
    - **Never expose credentials** in prompts, logs, or agent responses
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Latency Optimization">
    Slow calls pause the conversation.

    **Reduce latency**:
    - Use optimized endpoints (only request necessary data)
    - Limit response size (use parameters like `limit`, `fields`)
    - Consider caching data that doesn't change frequently
    - Monitor response times (target: < 2 seconds)

    **Example**:
    ```
    ✅ GOOD: GET /customers/123?fields=name,email,phone
    ❌ BAD: GET /customers/123 (returns 50 unnecessary fields)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error 401: Unauthorized">
    **Cause**: Incorrect or expired credentials.

    **Solution**:
    - Verify the authentication type is correct
    - Confirm the API key or token is active
    - Check if the token has the necessary permissions
    - For Bearer tokens, verify it hasn't expired
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error 404: Not Found">
    **Cause**: The endpoint doesn't exist.

    **Solution**:
    - Verify the base URL (should end with the API version, e.g., `/v1`)
    - Confirm the endpoint is spelled correctly
    - Check the documentation for API changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error 400: Bad Request">
    **Cause**: Missing or incorrectly formatted parameters.

    **Solution**:
    - Verify required parameters are configured
    - Confirm data types are correct (string, number, etc.)
    - Check that parameters are in the correct location (path, query, body)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error 429: Too Many Requests">
    **Cause**: Rate limit exceeded.

    **Solution**:
    - Check the API's rate limits in its documentation
    - Reduce call frequency
    - Consider upgrading your plan with the API provider
    - Implement caching for data that doesn't change frequently
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The tool is never used">
    **Cause**: The agent doesn't know when to use the tool.

    **Solution**:
    - Improve the tool description (be more specific)
    - In Single Prompt agents: add explicit instructions about when to use the tool
    - In Conversational Paths: make sure the correct node is configured to use the tool
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent uses the tool incorrectly">
    **Cause**: Poorly configured parameters or ambiguous description.

    **Solution**:
    - Check that parameters have clear descriptions
    - Make sure data types are correct
    - Improve instructions in the agent prompt
    - Use user confirmation for critical tools
  </Accordion>
