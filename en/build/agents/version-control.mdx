## What is Version Control?

Version control allows you to create and manage different versions of your agent safely. You can make changes in a draft, save working versions as backup, and publish when you're ready for your agent to handle live calls.

<Note>
**Why use versions?**

Version control protects you from costly mistakes:
- Make changes without affecting live calls
- Save working versions as backup
- Publish only when you're ready
- Revert to previous versions if something goes wrong
- Maintain a complete history of all changes
</Note>

## Fundamental Concepts

### Draft

This is your workspace where you make all changes to the agent. Think of it as a Google Docs document you're editing.

**Features:**
- Only visible to you in the dashboard
- You can modify it as many times as you want
- Saves automatically while you work
- Never used to handle real calls
- You can **publish** the draft so it handles live calls
- You can **save as version** to create a backup without publishing

### Published Version

This is the version that's handling live calls right now. It's the active configuration that your customers experience.

**Features:**
- This is the version used by all phone numbers assigned to your agent
- Handles all incoming calls at this moment
- There can only be **one published version** per agent at a time
- It's immutable (cannot be edited directly)
- If you try to edit it, a copy is automatically created in the draft
- Appears marked as "Published" in the history
- Has an assigned version number (v1, v2, v3, etc.)

<Warning>
To publish a version, you must have a phone number available in your project.
</Warning>

### Saved Versions

These are working copies of your agent that you've saved but aren't published. They're useful for maintaining different tested configurations without putting them live.

**Features:**
- Not live (don't handle calls)
- Immutable (cannot be edited)
- If you try to edit them, a copy is automatically created in the draft
- Useful for maintaining configurations that work well
- You can have multiple saved versions
- Each has its unique version number
- You can publish any of them at any time

### Version Numbering

**All versions receive an incremental number automatically**, regardless of whether you save or publish them.

- Your first agent starts as **v1**
- Saving the draft as a version → **v2**
- Publishing from the draft → **v3**
- Saving another version → **v4**
- And so on...

**Numbers never repeat** and always increase sequentially. This ensures each version has a unique identifier.

## Working with Versions in the Dashboard

### Editing Your Agent

When you edit any configuration of your agent in the dashboard, you're modifying the **draft**:

1. Navigate to your agent in the "Agents" section
2. Make the changes you need (prompt, voice, tools, etc.)
3. Changes are automatically saved to the draft
4. You'll see a "Draft" label indicating there are unsaved/unpublished changes

<Tip>
**Auto-save**

You don't need to worry about saving manually. The system automatically saves your changes to the draft while you work, similar to Google Docs.
</Tip>

### Saving the Draft as a Version

If you want to create a backup of your work without publishing:

1. Click the "Save version" button in the editor
2. Optionally, add a descriptive name (example: "Test with new greeting")
3. Confirm

**What happens when saving:**
- A new numbered version is created (v2, v3, etc.)
- This version is saved in the history
- It's NOT published (doesn't handle calls)
- The draft is maintained so you can keep working
- You can publish this version later if you want

**When to use "Save version":**
- You want to checkpoint work in progress
- You have a working configuration but want to keep experimenting
- You need to maintain multiple options before deciding which to publish
- You're working as a team and want to review before publishing

### Publishing a Version

When you're ready for your agent to handle live calls:

**Option 1: Publish from the draft**
1. Make sure the draft has the changes you want
2. Click "Publish"
3. Optionally, add a descriptive name
4. Confirm publication

**Option 2: Publish a saved version**
1. Go to version history
2. Find the version you want to publish
3. Click "Publish" next to that version
4. Confirm

**What happens when publishing:**
- The version is marked as "Published"
- All new calls use this version immediately
- If there was another published version, it stops being published (but remains in history)
- There can only be one published version at a time

<Warning>
**Impact on live calls**

When you publish a new version, it immediately affects all new calls. Calls in progress continue with the version they had. Make sure to test well before publishing.
</Warning>

### Editing a Saved or Published Version

Saved and published versions are **immutable** - they cannot be edited directly. This protects the integrity of the history.

**What happens if you try to edit them?**

When you click "Edit" on a saved or published version:

1. The system automatically creates a **complete copy** of that version
2. The copy is placed in your draft
3. You can freely modify the draft
4. The original version remains unchanged in history

<Warning>
  The draft created when editing a version overwrites any unsaved changes you had in the previous draft.
</Warning>

### Viewing Version History

Within your agent's editor, you can see the complete version history below your agent's name. This way you can select the version you want to view or edit.

## Call Tracking by Version

Each call your agent handles is associated with the specific version that managed it. This allows you to:

- See which version was used for each call in the call details
- Audit which version was used for each call
- Analyze performance of different versions
