## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the foundation for creating effective AI phone agents. A well-designed prompt determines how your agent interprets situations, responds to users, and handles edge cases. This guide provides proven strategies for writing prompts that agents can reliably follow.

<Note>
  This guide focuses on general prompt engineering principles. For type-specific implementation:

  * **Single Prompt Agents**: Apply these principles directly in your prompts
  * **Conversational Path Agents**: Use these principles within each node's instructions
</Note>


## Best Practice 1: Organize your prompt into sections

Long, unorganized prompts confuse language models. The solution is to structure your prompt into well-defined thematic blocks. This has important advantages:

* **Easy to maintain**: You can modify behavior in one area without touching the rest
* **Reusable**: Copy entire sections to other agents that need similar behaviors
* **Greater accuracy**: The model understands instructions better when they're categorized

### How to structure an effective prompt

Use clear headers to separate each type of instruction:

```markdown
## Identity
Define who the agent is and what it does.
You are [name], [role] at [company].
You specialize in [area of expertise].

## Style Rules
Establish how the agent should speak.
Respond in a maximum of 2 sentences when possible.
Speak naturally, as a real person would.
Acknowledge the user's emotions in your responses.

## Response Guidelines
Specific instructions about format and confirmations.
Say dates out loud: "January fifteenth" instead of "1/15".
One question at a time: don't overwhelm the user with multiple questions in a row.
Repeat important information: confirm numbers, dates, and names.

## Tasks to Perform
The exact steps the agent should follow.

## Handling Difficult Situations
What to say when the user reacts negatively.
If they say they're not interested: "I understand completely. May I ask what..."
If they seem frustrated: "I notice your frustration, I'll do everything possible to resolve this..."
```

<Accordion title="Complete Example: Customer Service Agent">

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Structured Prompt
## Identity
You are Ana, a customer service agent at TechSolutions.
Your role is to help customers with product inquiries, orders, and basic technical support.
You have experience in customer service and problem solving.

## Style Rules
Be concise: 1-2 sentence responses by default.
Be warm: Use a friendly and professional tone.
Be proactive: Anticipate customer needs.
Avoid technical jargon: Explain concepts in simple terms.

## Response Guidelines
Confirm critical information: Repeat order numbers, dates, and amounts.
Rephrase questions: If something isn't clear, ask for clarification specifically.
Offer alternatives: If you can't do something, suggest options.
Don't use abbreviations: Say "Monday through Friday" instead of "Mon-Fri".

## Company Knowledge
Hours: Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm, Saturdays 10am to 2pm.
Return policy: 30 days from purchase with receipt.
Standard shipping: 3-5 business days.
Main products: Laptops, tablets, office accessories.

## Task Instructions
1. Greet warmly and introduce yourself.
2. Ask how you can help.
3. Listen to the complete inquiry before responding.
4. Provide the requested information clearly.
5. Ask if they need additional help.
6. Say goodbye professionally.

## Handling Objections
If the customer is upset: "I understand your frustration. Let me see how I can resolve this."
If you don't have the information: "I don't have that information right now. I can transfer you to someone who can help."
If they request something impossible: "I can't do that directly, but what I can do is..."
```

```markdown Conversation Example
User: Hi, I have a problem with my order.
Agent: Hello, I'm Ana from TechSolutions. I'm sorry you're having a problem. Can you tell me what happened?

User: I ordered a laptop a week ago and it still hasn't arrived.
Agent: I understand. Do you have the order number handy?

User: Yes, it's 45892.
Agent: Perfect, four five eight nine two. Give me a moment to check.

[Checks system]

Agent: I see your order shipped 4 days ago. Standard shipping takes 3 to 5 days, so it should arrive in the next two days. Should I send you the tracking number by message?

User: Yes, please.
Agent: Done, I just sent it. Is there anything else I can help you with?

User: No, that's all.
Agent: Perfect. Thanks for calling, have a great day.
```

## Best Practice 2: When to migrate to Conversational Paths

Not all use cases work well with a single prompt. If your agent starts becoming unpredictable or the prompt becomes too long, it's time to consider a Conversational Path agent.

### Signs you need to change architecture:

* **Your prompt has too many "if... then" statements**: When you exceed 3-4 conditions, the model starts getting confused
* **You use many tools**: With more than 5 integrations, the agent doesn't know when to use each one
* **You need to remember information**: If you must track variables between different moments in the conversation
* **Erratic behavior**: The agent responds well sometimes and fails other times in the same scenario

### What you gain with Conversational Paths:

* **Focus**: Each node has a single purpose, without distractions
* **Reliability**: Transitions and tools are triggered deterministically, not dependent on interpretation
* **Simpler debugging**: You can identify exactly which node is failing
* **Consistency**: Behavior is predictable because it's explicitly programmed

<Tip>
**Rule of thumb**: If you've written more than 3 blocks of "If the user mentions X, then do Y", your use case probably works better with a structured flow.
</Tip>

## Best Practice 3: Be explicit with tools

<Note>This section applies only to Single Prompt Agents. Conversational Path Agents manage function calls automatically based on each node's configuration.</Note>

### Why it's important

A common mistake is thinking the model will know when to use each tool just by reading its description. In practice, this doesn't work well. The result is an agent that:

* Uses tools when it shouldn't
* Ignores tools when it should use them
* Confuses which tool to use in each situation

### The solution: step-by-step instructions

You need to tell the agent exactly when to activate each tool. Don't leave anything to interpretation. Use the exact function names in the instructions.

#### Example: Customer Service Agent

```markdown
## Tool Usage Instructions

1. Gather initial information about the customer's problem.

2. Determine the type of request:
   - If the customer mentions "refund" or "return money":
     → Call the `transfer_to_support` function immediately
   - If the customer needs order status:
     → Call the `check_order_status` function with order_id
   - If the customer wants to change their order:
     → First call `check_order_status`
     → Then transition to modification_state

3. After retrieving information:
   - Always summarize what you found
   - Ask if they need additional help
   - If yes, determine the next appropriate action
```

#### Example: Restaurant Reservation Agent

```markdown
## Tool Usage Instructions

1. Greet and ask for how many people and what date they want to reserve.

2. Once you have both pieces of information:
   → Call `check_availability` with date and number_of_people

3. Analyze the result:
   - If there's availability:
     • Offer the available time slot options
     • Wait for customer confirmation
     → Call `create_reservation` with all the data
   - If there's NO availability:
     • Offer nearby alternative dates
     • If the customer accepts an alternative:
       → Call `check_availability` again with the new date

4. After creating the reservation:
   → Call `send_confirmation` with the reservation number
   → Verbally confirm all details to the customer

5. IMPORTANT: Never call `create_reservation` without first verifying availability.
```

### Keys to writing effective tool instructions

1. **Keywords**: Specify what terms or phrases the agent should hear to activate each tool
2. **Execution order**: If one tool depends on another, make it clear. For example: "first query, then create"
3. **Restrictions**: Equally important is saying when NOT to use a tool. Avoid unnecessary calls
4. **Justification**: Add a line explaining what each tool is for. It helps the model understand the purpose

## Best Practice 4: Optimization for Voice Conversations

Unlike text chatbots, phone agents must generate responses that sound natural when spoken. This requires special considerations:

### Formatting Rules for Voice

```markdown
## Response Guidelines for Voice

Dates: Say "March fifteenth, twenty twenty-five" not "03/15/2025"
Times: Say "three in the afternoon" not "3:00 PM"
Phone numbers: Say "six one two, three four, five six" grouping digits
Amounts: Say "twenty dollars" not "$20.00"
URLs: Don't spell them out. Say "I'll send you the link by message"
Emails: Don't spell them out. Say "I'll send you the information by email"
Lists: Maximum 3 options. If there are more, ask what type they're looking for first.

NEVER use:
- Asterisks or emojis: *smiles* 😊
- Abbreviations: "M-F" → "Monday through Friday"
- Internet slang: "LOL", "OMG"
- Symbols: "+", "@", "#"
```

### Response Length Control

```markdown
## Brevity Rules

Default response: Maximum 2 sentences
Complex explanation: Maximum 4 sentences, then ask if it was clear
Option lists: Maximum 3 items at a time
If there's a lot of information: Break it into parts and ask what they want to know first

BAD Example:
"We have five types of insurance: the basic that covers accidents and liability,
the premium that includes all the above plus theft and partial damage coverage,
the family plan that extends coverage to all household members..."

GOOD Example:
"We have basic, premium, and family plans. Which one would you like me to explain?"
```

### Handling Interruptions

```markdown
## Interruption Behavior

If the user interrupts you:
1. Stop immediately what you're saying
2. Don't repeat what you already said
3. Respond to the new thing they mentioned
4. Only ask if they want to return to the previous topic if it was critical

Example:
Agent: "The business hours are Monday through—"
User: "And the price?"
Agent: "The starting price is fifty dollars. Would you like to know about other plans?"
[Does NOT repeat the hours unless the user asks]
```

## Iteration and Optimization

Iteration is key to perfecting your prompts. Here's a recommended process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a simple prompt">
    Use the structures from this guide as a starting point.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with real scenarios">
    Make 5-10 test calls with different types of queries.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify failure patterns">
    Review transcripts to detect:
    - Moments where the agent doesn't know what to do
    - Responses that sound unnatural
    - Incorrect tool usage
    - Incorrect or outdated information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine specific sections">
    Adjust only the parts of the prompt that caused problems and start the process again
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Testing strategy**: Ask someone who doesn't know your agent to make a real call. Their experience will show you problems you wouldn't see because you know how it "should" work.
</Tip>
