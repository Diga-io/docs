## Introduction

Once you've created your integrations (HTTP or MCP), you need to **assign them to your agents** so they can use the tools during calls. This process allows you to control:

- **Which agents** have access to which integrations
- **Which specific tools** from each integration each agent can use
- **In which version** of the agent the tools are available

This gives you granular control over what actions each agent can perform, following the principle of least privilege.

<Note>
  **Prerequisite**: Before assigning integrations to an agent, you need to have created the integrations. If you haven't done so yet, see:
  - [HTTP Integrations](/en/build/integrations/http-integrations)
  - [MCP Integrations](/en/build/integrations/mcp-integrations)
</Note>

## Assign Integration to an Agent

The following describes the steps to assign an existing integration to an agent in single prompt mode. If you want to add integrations to a Conversational Path agent, see the corresponding section on [tool nodes](/en/build/agents/conversational-paths/node-types)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Agent">
    From the dashboard, go to the **Agents** section and select the agent you want to add integrations to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    In the agent configuration that appears in the sidebar, select the **Integrations** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Integration">
    Click **Add Integration** and select the integration you want to assign.

    All integrations available in your project will be shown, plus the ability to create a new integration directly from this menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Tools">

    After selecting the integration, you'll see a list of all the tools it contains. Here you can select which specific tools you want this agent to be able to use.

    <Warning>
      Only give access to the tools the agent actually needs. The agent will perform better with fewer tool options.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the configuration.

    The integration with its tools is now available for this version of the agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Filtering by Agent

Different agents have different needs. Filtering allows you to assign the same integration to multiple agents, but with access to different tools.

### Example: Shared CRM Integration

Imagine a "Customer CRM" integration with 10 tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent: Customer Support">
    **Needs**:
    - Search customer
    - Check orders
    - Create support tickets
    - Update contact information

    **Doesn't need**:
    - Create sales opportunities
    - Close sales
    - Modify prices
    - Delete customers

    **Configuration**:
    ```
    Integration: Customer CRM
    Allowed tools: 4 of 10
      ✅ search_customer
      ✅ check_order
      ✅ create_ticket
      ✅ update_contact
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent: Inbound Sales">
    **Needs**:
    - Search customer
    - Create opportunities
    - Update opportunities
    - Check sales pipeline

    **Doesn't need**:
    - Create support tickets
    - Delete customers
    - Export data

    **Configuration**:
    ```
    Integration: Customer CRM
    Allowed tools: 4 of 10
      ✅ search_customer
      ✅ create_opportunity
      ✅ update_opportunity
      ✅ check_pipeline
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent: Account Manager">
    **Needs**:
    - Search customer
    - Update complete information
    - Check history
    - Export reports

    **Doesn't need**:
    - Delete customers (too dangerous)
    - Modify base prices

    **Configuration**:
    ```
    Integration: Customer CRM
    Allowed tools: 6 of 10
      ✅ search_customer
      ✅ update_customer
      ✅ check_history
      ✅ export_report
      ✅ create_note
      ✅ schedule_meeting
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Integrations per Agent

An agent can have **multiple integrations** assigned simultaneously. This is useful when it needs to interact with several systems.

### Example: E-commerce Agent

```
Agent: "E-commerce Support"

Assigned integrations:

1. Integration: Order System
   Tools:
     - check_order
     - check_shipping
     - cancel_order

2. Integration: Payment Platform
   Tools:
     - check_transaction
     - process_refund (with confirmation)

3. Integration: Customer CRM
   Tools:
     - search_customer
     - update_contact

4. Integration: Inventory System
   Tools:
     - check_availability
     - verify_stock
```

During a call, this agent can:
1. Search for the customer in the CRM
2. Check their order in the Order System
3. Verify payment status in the Payment Platform
4. If necessary, process a refund (with user confirmation)
5. Check availability of alternative products in Inventory

<Tip>
  **Organization**: Group related tools into separate integrations. It's easier to manage "Payments Integration" + "CRM Integration" than a single "Mega Integration" with 50 tools.
</Tip>

## Verify Configuration

After assigning integrations, verify that everything is configured correctly:

### Test in Real Call

The best way to validate is to make test calls:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test scenarios">
    Define scenarios that require using each tool:
    - "The user wants to know the status of their order 12345"
    - "The user requests a refund"
    - "The user wants to update their email"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute the calls">
    Call the agent and present each scenario
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify behavior">
    Confirm that:
    - The agent uses the correct tool
    - Parameters are sent correctly
    - The tool returns expected data
    - The agent interprets and communicates the response appropriately
    - User confirmation works when enabled
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the logs">
    Check the call logs to see:
    - Which tools were executed
    - What parameters were sent
    - What responses were received
    - If there were errors
  </Step>
</Steps>
